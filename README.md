# Is STaR Bright Enough

Enhanced STaR Algorithm for Banking - This repository contains the implementation of the Enhanced Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) Algorithm, specifically adapted for the banking industry. It extends the original STaR algorithm with advanced rationale generation, banking-specific optimizations, and a continuous learning framework to maintain accuracy and relevance over time.

The conceptual script is an iteration of the original STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner) algorithm to give you an idea of what the implementation might entail tailored for the banking industry. It incorporates a rationale generation mechanism, banking-specific context enrichment, and a continuous learning framework.

The core of the script revolves around iterative learning, where a large language model (LLM) is fine-tuned in a loop to improve its ability to generate accurate rationales for banking-related queries. In each iteration, the model generates rationales and is then directed to re-evaluate incorrect answers with additional context, leading to an enhanced rationalization process. This helps the model learn from its mistakes and refine its reasoning for future queries.

To ensure relevance to the banking domain, the script enriches input data with context-specific information before processing and verifies the compliance of the outputs with banking regulations. This two-pronged approach ensures that the model's rationales are not only accurate but also aligned with industry standards.

The approach introduces a continuous learning component, allowing the model to be updated periodically with new data. This reflects the dynamic nature of the financial sector and ensures that the model remains current and effective over time.

## Features

- **Advanced Rationalization**: Improves the model's learning from incorrect responses by generating targeted rationales.
- **Banking-Specific Context**: Enriches input data with banking-specific context to ensure industry relevance and compliance.
- **Continuous Learning**: Periodically updates the model with new data to keep up with the evolving financial sector.
