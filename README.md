# Enhanced STaR Algorithm for Banking - Is STaR Bright Enough

This repository contains the implementation of the Enhanced Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR) Algorithm, specifically adapted for the banking industry. It extends the original STaR algorithm with advanced rationale generation, banking-specific optimizations, and a continuous learning framework to maintain accuracy and relevance over time.

## Features

- **Advanced Rationalization**: Improves the model's learning from incorrect responses by generating targeted rationales.
- **Banking-Specific Context**: Enriches input data with banking-specific context to ensure industry relevance and compliance.
- **Continuous Learning**: Periodically updates the model with new data to keep up with the evolving financial sector.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
